# wiki-dumps
[By The Sword Linked](https://www.bytheswordlinked.uk/) is an experimental project to create a new finding aid and reference work about the British Civil Wars (c.1639-1660). It uses Semantic MediaWiki to publish structured data and free text. Most users should be able to find named entities and related sources using search suggestions and following links through the wiki without having to use SPARQL. This repository provides advanced users with dumps of the entire contents of the wiki.

Data files available are as follows:

- by-the-sword-linked-RDF-dump.rdf.zip: all semantic properties from the wiki exported as OWL DL serialized as RDF/XML. This does not include free text or non-semantic template parameters. Has to be zipped otherwise it's too big to upload to Github.
- by-the-sword-linked-Wikitext-dump.xml.zip: the wikitext source code of every page in the wiki exported as [wikitext XML](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Export#Export_format). Has to be zipped otherwise it's too big to upload to Github.
- by-the-sword-linked-Wikitext-Structure.xml: the wikitext source code of every page in the following namespaces: Property, Template, Form, Category, Help. This gives the data structures of the wiki without the content.

Some of the wiki templates rely on tag extensions that have not yet been released to the public.
